# About MCAlt
MCAlt is an "alternate timeline" mod for Minecraft b1.7.3, developed using [Modification Station's StationAPI](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI). 
It adds various new features, along with re-adding some content from newer versions that weren't present in b1.7.3, such as the Spruce and Birch wood types.
## Snapshots
MCAlt is very early in development, but snapshots will occasionally be released for the purpose of bugfixing and getting feedback from a wide audience.
These versions will always be released as MultiMC Instances at [KingJacob's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9XaYmJr7QD).
